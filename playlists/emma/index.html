    <h1>Emma's Pandemic Playlist</h1>
        <p>As much that COVID-19 has destroyed the world in physical and psychological health, there also was a lot of moments
				that outshined the negative clouds corroding us. I believe everything happens for a reason, this virus has taught us to never take life, memories,
				family, or friendships for granted. My top ten songs are a lot -	bops that made me sing my lungs out, lyrics making me remember the past,
				songs heard in moments I'll never forget, or words that	reflect on the life to come after we get through this.</p><br>

            <h2>The Sounds</h2>
              <p>The artists fall into a plethora of genres: country, r&b, hip-hop, and alternative. I grew up listening to country and my happiest childhood memories
								are the days my family would be driving to the beach blasting it while the sun shined and waves crashed. As I grew older, I got into hip-hop and r&b as a lot of
							  young adults do, and this style of music pumps me up and makes me want to never start partying. Alternative is a source of both calmness and difference in vibes from my
							  two opposing genres. In the pandemic, country played the biggest part in helping me reminisce my past as well as good times with my friends. <b>7 Summers</b> was my top song,
								and not only do I absolutely adore Morgan Wallen, but the title reminded me of my childhood in the past summers, same as <b>betty</b>. <b>S&M</b> has always made me want to get
								up and dance, as well as <b>Russian Roulette</b> and <b>Out West</b>. Songs like <b>You and Islands</b> and <b>Six Feet Apart</b> are more pandemic based and inspire me to
								look forward to what is to come in the future. <b>Holy</b> and <b>Faith</b> are more religious as I am Catholic, but inspire hopefulness as well. Then, songs like <b>Stay in My Corner</b>
								played when I was carefree and went to the lake to escape from the madness and get into nature over Summer. All incredibly different but <i>meaningful</i> to me.</p>
